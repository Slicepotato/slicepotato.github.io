				<p>Design has been a big part of my life for some time now. It's funny that you start creative design with the lofty ideas of building worlds and universes for others to exist within. There is a touch of megalomania in all designers. Tolkien could have just told a story; simply written down the adventures of Frodo and Sam beyond the Shire, but he went farther in designing his world. He provided a visual reference for his world. He designed communities, languages, and religions to inhabit his world. That vision is the difference between just telling a story and creating an experience.</p>
			</section>

			<section class="content-wrap">
				<p>User Experience (UX) is just as important as the User Interface (UI) that guides it. If users can't feel comfortable with how to navigate the information of a website, it doesn't matter how "cool" it looks. People will go elsewhere. The site needs to make sense within it's respective context. Tolkien including a map of Middle Earth in his books allowed for a more interactive involvement to his story. It provided boundaries to peoples' imaginations that they could follow while still allowing them to fill in the appropriate gaps.</p>
				<p>UX/UI Design <em>can</em> often be an arduous process. Balancing the needs of the user against the wants of the client is typically a delicate tight-rope act. The biggest question is always; "How do I begin?" Find your client needs and expectations: Who is their target audience? What are they looking to accomplish? What is the story they are trying to tell? When are they wanting to have their project ready? Does the client have any examples of design that they have liked... why?</p>

				<h2>Test Examples</h2>
				<p>Here are a couple examples of UI/UX Designs that I have worked on or thought about:</p>
				<ul class="example">
					<li><a id="staffpunch" href="staffpunch.html" title="StaffPunch"><img src="img/web-view.png"/></a></li>
					<li><a id="food-truck" href="food-truck.html" title="Find that Food Truck"><img src="img/web-view.png"/></a></li>
					<li><a id="highlands" href="highlands-of-louisville.html" title="Highlands of Louisville"><img src="img/web-view.png"/></a></li>

				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>So how did I get here? I started with a pipe dream of art and animation at the beginning of my higher education. I've always had a drive for the creative. I soon discovered that web development was a growing technology that provided near immediate results. The problem, however, was that there was no guided means to learn the ins and outs of the fertile land of the internet.</p>
				<p>We were taught the psychology of color and form, the nuances of how shape and light make you feel. No one had a clue how to adequately teach what it meant to plan an interactive user interface. Then, they were crude and rudimentary and, by and large, focused on periodical layouts and static page design. The internet grows and changes from one device to the next; from one user to the next. While the foundational ideologies of generations of print design are still very much tried and true, there is always more that digital interactive mediums bring.</p>

				<h2>Print</h2>
				<p>Logo design, posters, flyers... no matter the substrate, it is often the first thing anyone sees. Branding is an important detail in the scope of an overall design.</p>

It's always a thrill to see art or design work that you do that can end up on something the likes of a t-shirt or other potentially swag materials.</p>

				<h2>Web</h2>
				<p>Much of my web work lately has been within a very collaborative environment, but structured away from the details of UX/UI design. The best comparison would be closer to that of strictly construction rather than also participating in the archetechting of many of the sites that I have been involved in for 3 years prior to 2018.</p>

				</ul>
				<p>All in all in those 3 years I estimate a minumum of a dozen "from scratch" sites annually based on UX/UI designer mockups and client feedback. Some of these still require visual retouches during development to accomidate platform limitations and communication to the client on potential development edits was always a priority to keep up to date upon.</p>

				<h2>What else am I up to?</h2>
				<p>Lately, podcast/audio production has always been a side hobby. Being a little more involved in the community does have some fun perks and there are great people to get to know. I'm a HUGE fan of "builder" games. Things Like Sim City, Cities Skylines, Minecraft, Space Engineers tend to keep a fair amount of time when the inspiration hits. I have been working on builing a replica of Louisville on Cities Skylines when I can get time to pick at it. Civil Engineering has always been a passing interest.</p>
				<p>I've been big into Dungeons & Dragons for years. There's an excitement to world building on that scale that can never be matched. Whenever I have ideas, I add to a resource called <a target="_blank" href="http://niverdeen.obsidianportal.com/">Obsidian Portal</a> that allows me to organize my D&D world buiding.</p>

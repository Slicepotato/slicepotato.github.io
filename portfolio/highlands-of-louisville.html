                <h2>Project Scope</h2>
                <p>The city that you live in is typically the one place you want to see thrive and succeed. When you find that there are areas that have some issues you have two choices: do something about it or look the other way. <a href="http://www.thehighlandsoflouisville.com/" target="_blank">The Highlands of Louisville</a> is, classically, a weird and diverse place. Unfortunately the website that represents it looks as if it never left 1997. Needless to say, it could use a bit of a refresh, so I thought I might work out a little project for myself. The main goals of this are to clean up and reorganize the design and ad space. Provide a responsive layout that is easy for mobile viewing, and offer more current site interactivity and services to better help the user navigate and consume site contents.</p>
                
                <p>Means of an adequate informational platform would be important. Wordpress would be the utility of choice for ease of setup, and maintenance and future planning for a jaunty events calendar ui. I also noted a few features that I felt should be updated from the original. </p>

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>First on the list of things to do was the branding. I came up with a couple of ideas based on the original logo… at least, what I considered as such. The key element looked to be an important thing to note. To keep the design simple, I decided that the final logo would not have the key. Perhaps there would be a better use for this later on.</p>

                <h3>The Map</h3>
                <p>It’s cute and while it does make for a clever graphic, I think it would better be served as print promotional material rather than digital and interactive consumption. As for the web, a different solution like Google Maps or Open Street Map would be my primary choices. Using one of these would allow me to utilize the inherent marker systems in order to better pinpoint locations and provide more concise information to the user.</p>

                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <div class="side-by-side">
                  <div class="lt">
                    <p>Clear and available navigation can be crucial for a site. In this case, simplifying and streamlining was the only option.</p>
                    <ul class="list">
                      <li>Events</li>
                      <li>Commercial Services</li>
                      <li>Residential Information</li>
                      <li>Hangouts</li>
                      <li>Real Estate</li>
                      <li>Shops and Galleries</li>
                      <li>Restaurants</li>
                      <li>Highland Commerce Guild</li>
                      <li>Parks</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                  <div class="rt">
                    <p>These would have to be changed and worked out better for a smoother user experience. Moving down to fewer items with better and more fun titles should do the trick.</p>
                    <ul class="list">
                      <li>Home (logo)</li>
                      <li>Food & Fun (restaurants, hangouts & Galleries)</li>
                      <li>Shop Local (shops, commercial services)</li>
                      <li>Live with Us (Real Estate & Housing)</li>
                      <li>Parks & Rec</li>
                      <li>Our Community
                        <ul class="sub-list">
                          <li>Organizations</li>
                          <li>Highland Commerce Guild</li>
                        </ul>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <h3>The elephant in the room... Ad Space</h3>
                <p>I feel that ad space is one of the largest drawbacks. There is just too much of the site taken up by haphazardly arranged ads. The ads, themselves, need a place to exist apart from much of the content and they need uniformity in pixel real estate. Having a few set sizes would make it easier to leverage a common pricing system for the ad size and, depending on the presentation method, the ad frequency. Clearly, to exist this site must have sponsorship, but we can make that a little more appealing for the user to deal with.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>1600x100 - Full (content) Width</li>
                  <li>1600x300 - Full Content Tall</li>
                  <li>740x100 - ½ Content Width</li>
                  <li>740x200 - ½  Content Width Tall</li>
                  <li>380x100 - ¼ Full Width Carousel380x380 - Full sidebar (square)</li>
                  <li>380x190 - Full sidebar (2:1)</li>
                  <li>180x180 - ½ sidebar (square)</li>
                  <li>180x90 - ½ sidebar (2:1)  </li>
                  <li>88x31 - Mini Button</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                <p>Next it would come to wireframing and prototyping. I guess this is really a case where the sky is the limit. </p>

                <p>Mobile first design is a method that I often  read about, but that I find I don’t use as much as I would like to admit. Clever ad placement would really be the key on working out this refresh. Having all of the ad space more spread out across the content should ease the user into not feeling so overwhelmed at the heavy sponsorship.</p>

                <ul class="dialog-pop proto">
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="img/screens/hol-m-home-1.jpg" src="img/screens/hol-m-home-1.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="img/screens/hol-m-home-2.jpg" src="img/screens/hol-m-home-2.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="img/screens/hol-m-home-3.jpg" src="img/screens/hol-m-home-3.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Fly out navigation and map filter menus would keep that content boxed up nicely so as not to clutter the focus on info on the home page. I played with the idea of the primary navigation pushing the whole page container aside in this case… in fact that still may be a go to route.</p>

                <ul class="dialog-pop proto">
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="img/screens/hol-m-nav.jpg" src="img/screens/hol-m-nav.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="img/screens/hol-m-filter.jpg" src="img/screens/hol-m-filter.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="img/screens/hol-m-sidebar.jpg" src="img/screens/hol-m-sidebar.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>By much of the nature of Wordpress’ post loop, peppering in ads within the post information is a difficult exercise for me. I wouldn’t expect it to be completely impossible. Either way, more research on this method is needed. For the time being the "sidebar" ads will have to live at the bottom and independent of the post loop.</p>

                <ul class="dialog-pop proto">
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="img/screens/hol-m-food.jpg" src="img/screens/hol-m-food.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="img/screens/hol-m-parks.jpg" src="img/screens/hol-m-parks.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>To keep it manageable for the most desktop users, an open primary content block and menu header with a very standard alt-color footer should suffice. I figured that dedicated front page space for Community and/or site news would be best directly under the map followed by a quick “upcoming events” list to get an idea of what’s happening in the days or weeks close by. A sidebar would hopefully be the way to go to feature specific ad content.</p>

                <ul class="dialog-pop proto">
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="img/screens/hol-desk-home.jpg" src="img/screens/hol-desk-home.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="img/screens/hol-desk-filter.jpg" src="img/screens/hol-desk-filter.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="img/screens/hol-desk-food.jpg" src="img/screens/hol-desk-food.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="img/screens/hol-desk-parks.jpg" src="img/screens/hol-desk-parks.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Wrap Up</h2>
                <p>So far, simply cleaning up the overall design lends to some better information flow and a site that would be considerably more pleasing to the user across multiple devices. Again with the benefits of a platform like Wordpress. Much of the work would, honestly, be transposing the lists and lists of information from the site currently to something of a more common blog design. Many of the service and business specific links can be routed directly from the post meta without having to make any detailed post information save a title and a description summary. It would prove to be an interesting level of marketing, for that matter to inherently sell that post page out as ad space to that business or service which could hold a few items like detailed information, promotional information, events listing and so on.</p>

                <p>There is space to be used for further revenue opportunities that I believe would be better accepted and more appropriate with a fresher design and current platform. Being a pet side project, updates to this may get a little sparse at times but at this point the next step I would take for my own development would be core functional layout design within Wordpess and theme design.</p>

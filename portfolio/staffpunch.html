                <h2>Project Scope</h2>
                <p>StaffPunch came to be out of internal necessity and a desire to want something a little different that what was available. during my tenure with SDF Technical we made a challenge for ourselves in between projects. The ultimate end goal was to make a product. Something that we could not only use, but sell and offer to other businesses. We figured that a year would have been a sufficient timeline set in order to launch.</p>
                <p>We began with writing down what we needed the application to accomplish:</p>
                <div class="side-by-side">
                    <ul class="lt list">
                        <li>A running clock</li>
                        <li>a method to "punch in" and "punch out"</li>
                        <li>break and lunch handling</li>
                        <li>user roles and administration</li>
                        <li>department/groups administration</li>
                        <li>reporting</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span class="img-wrap">
                        <img src="../img/screens/sp-postit.png" />
                    </span>
                </div>
                
                <h2>Research</h2>
                <p>We scoured the internet to see how other applications worked out time tracking. We found that <a target="_blank" href="https://toggl.com/features">Toggl</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.timedoctor.com/">TimeDoctor</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.getharvest.com/features/time-tracking">Harvest</a> had the all of the features that we were looking to emulate. Going by what we had found we wanted to make something simpler looking that had room to grow.</p>
                
                <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                <p>I, then, became responsible for taking the information that we had gathered and coming up with a core UI schema. The idea of a visual representation of time was to be the main focus. Instead of a simple ticking clock, the goal was to show the user where they were in the day; designated by a red line, and grow their active statuses on the timeline as the day progressed.</p>
                <ul class="dialog-pop proto">
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="../img/screens/sp-timeline-today.jpg" src="../img/screens/sp-timeline-today.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="../img/screens/sp-timeline-week.jpg" src="../img/screens/sp-timeline-week.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <button type="button"><img data-img="../img/screens/sp-activity-list.jpg" src="../img/screens/sp-activity-list.jpg"/></button>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Making different UI options for application user roles became apparent. What would a standard user see? What would an administrative user see. What about a user that had a more flexible role like a moderator or some other middle-management?</p>
                
                <h2>Functional Development</h2>
                <p>Timing the line animation to only move as a clock was quite possiply the most difficult feature. There were initial settings that had to be taken into account such as user time zone in order to line up everything properly. After that it was a matter of using a javascript plugin called <a target="_blank" href="https://momentjs.com/">Moment</a> to connect that to the front end UI display.</p>
                <span class="img-wrap"><img src="../img/screens/sp-timeline-animate.gif" /></span>
                <p>Once the milestones of allowing the user to log in to the application, "Punch In", "Punch Out" and "Go to Lunch" were completed it came down to more UI refinements and adding in the task activities.</p>
                
                <h2>Wrap Up</h2>
                <p>The front end of the site was the last thing to be fully assembled. While the rest of the application was being constructed, the marketing copy was still being discussed and decided. Logo design went through many revisions until we finally came together on design that we liked.</p>
